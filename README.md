 RBX.COOL Source Code

# About

This is the source code for RBX.COOL. It was a project I developed for partyparrot during 2020. RBX.COOL was sold to a couple of troglodytes in last December and I have since quit the project. I am releasing the source as a sort of resource for newer developers to look at and learn from. I highly recommend doing a full security audit if you plan on running this. There are a couple of vulnerabilities I haven't patched, one of which can give users infinite balance. Treat this as a resource and nothing more.
