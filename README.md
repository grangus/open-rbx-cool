 RBX.COOL Source Code

# About

This is the source code for RBX.COOL. It was a project I developed for partyparrot during 2020. RBX.COOL was sold to a couple of troglodytes last December and I have since quit the project. I am releasing the source as a sort of resource for newer developers to look at and learn from. This was mostly a learning project. I highly recommend you not attempt to run it as it is poorly optimized and there are a couple of vulnerabilities I haven't patched(one of which can give users infinite balance). Treat this as a resource for learning about Roblox API's and nothing more.
